    <td> I learned the very basics of python and css and now I am confident in making my own blog and webpage. My best strategy was taking notes when Mr Keen/Tansley were talking and not getting distracted by other people asking for help or just talking for the sake of talking.</td>

    <td>  I need to work on learning from my mistakes and making sure I stay on track to complete my goal in lessons. I also think that my note taking skills at the start of the year were poor and that limited my learning a great deal.</td>
